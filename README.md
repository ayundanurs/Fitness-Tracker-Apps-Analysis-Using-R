# Fitness-Tracker-Apps-Analysis-Using-R

Welcome to my project on Fitness Tracker Analysis! This project is part of the Google Data Analytics certification, where I applied data analytics techniques to analyze the data collected from fitness tracking devices.

* ## Project Overview 
In this analysis, I explored the Bellabeat fitness tracker products to understand user behavior. Bellabeat product is collecting data on  activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health.  By examining the data from these devices, I sought to uncover insights about how users interact with the device and their activity patterns, such as sleep, steps, heart rate, and calories burned.

* ## Key Findings
Activity and Heart Rate: A strong correlation between activity intensity and heart rate.
Step and Calories: The relationship between step count and calories burned is observed to be significant, with more active days leading to higher calorie burn.
Sleep and Activity: Sleep duration varies widely among users, indicating potential areas for improvement in daily routines.
User Behavior Patterns: Some users display consistent activity patterns, while others have more fluctuating behavior.

* ## Tools Used
Kaggle: Dataset resource https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit 
R: Used for data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization.
